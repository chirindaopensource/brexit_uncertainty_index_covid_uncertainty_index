        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This project provides a Python implementation of the methodologies presented in the 2025 paper \"Introducing a New Brexit-Related Uncertainty Index: Its Evolution and Economic Consequences.\" The core of this repository is the iPython Notebook `brexit_related_uncertainty_index_draft.ipynb`, which contains a comprehensive suite of functions to construct the Brexit-Related Uncertainty Index (BRUI) and its complementary COVID-19 Related Uncertainty Index (CRUI), and to analyze their economic consequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "Measuring geopolitical risk is a critical challenge in modern finance and economics. Abstract concepts like \"uncertainty\" must be transformed into quantifiable metrics to be useful for risk pricing, capital allocation, and policy formulation. This framework provides a rigorous, data-driven approach to this problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "This codebase enables researchers, policymakers, and financial analysts to:\n",
        "-   Construct a high-frequency, text-based measure of Brexit uncertainty from raw documents.\n",
        "-   Methodologically disentangle Brexit-related uncertainty from concurrent shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
        "-   Analyze the dynamic impact of uncertainty shocks on key macroeconomic variables.\n",
        "-   Replicate and extend the findings of the original research paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Theoretical Background\n",
        "\n",
        "The implemented methods are grounded in a combination of advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and standard time-series econometrics:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Context-Aware Uncertainty Attribution:** The core of the index construction is a novel algorithm that moves beyond simple keyword counting. It requires the co-occurrence of an \"uncertainty\" term and a \"Brexit\" term within a small, defined text window (10 words on either side). This ensures that the measured uncertainty is contextually relevant.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Proportional Allocation for Disentanglement:** In periods where both Brexit and COVID-19 are discussed together, the algorithm does not discard the data. Instead, it uses a proportional allocation mechanism based on the relative frequency of \"pure\" Brexit and \"pure\" COVID-19 uncertainty mentions in the same document to disentangle the two effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Vector Autoregression (VAR) Modeling:** To assess the economic impact of the newly constructed index, the pipeline employs a standard VAR model. This multivariate time-series model captures the dynamic interdependencies between the BRUI and key macroeconomic variables (GDP, CPI, trade, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cholesky Decomposition for Identification:** To identify the causal impact of an uncertainty shock, a Cholesky decomposition is applied to the VAR model's residuals. By ordering the BRUI first in the system, the model operates under the standard economic assumption that uncertainty shocks are contemporaneously exogenous—they affect the economy within the same month, but are not themselves affected by the economy within that same month.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "\n",
        "The provided iPython Notebook (`brexit_related_uncertainty_index_draft.ipynb`) implements the full research pipeline, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Parameter Validation:** Rigorous checks for all input data and configurations to ensure methodological compliance.\n",
        "-   **Data Cleansing:** Robust handling of missing and non-finite values, and precise temporal filtering.\n",
        "-   **Advanced NLP Pipeline:** Text normalization, tokenization, context-aware stopword removal, and n-gram analysis.\n",
        "-   **LLM-Powered Entity Recognition:** Use of SpaCy's `en_core_web_lg` to prepare for entity-based analysis.\n",
        "-   **Context-Aware Attribution Algorithm:** The core algorithm for identifying and classifying uncertainty mentions.\n",
        "-   **Index Construction:** Proportional allocation, standardization, and max-normalization to create the final BRUI and CRUI.\n",
        "-   **Econometric Data Preparation:** Systematic stationarity testing (ADF) and data transformations (log, differencing).\n",
        "-   **VAR Modeling:** Automated optimal lag selection, model estimation, and diagnostic testing.\n",
        "-   **Post-Estimation Analysis:** Calculation of Impulse Response Functions (IRFs), Forecast Error Variance Decompositions (FEVDs), and bootstrapped confidence intervals.\n",
        "-   **Publication-Quality Visualization:** A suite of functions to generate the key figures from the paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Methodology Implemented\n",
        "\n",
        "The core analytical steps directly implement the methodology from the paper:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Text Corpus Processing (Steps 1-8):** The pipeline ingests monthly EIU reports, cleans the text, and processes it using a standard NLP workflow (normalization, tokenization, stopword removal).\n",
        "2.  **Context-Aware Attribution (Step 9):** For each \"uncertainty\" keyword, a 21-word context window is analyzed. The presence of Brexit and/or COVID-19 keywords within this window determines the classification of the uncertainty mention.\n",
        "3.  **Proportional Allocation (Step 10):** For \"mixed\" contexts containing both Brexit and COVID-19 keywords, the uncertainty count is allocated proportionally to the BRUI and CRUI based on the relative prevalence of \"pure\" mentions in the same document.\n",
        "4.  **Index Finalization (Step 11):** The raw uncertainty counts are standardized by the total word count of the report and then normalized so that the maximum value of the index over the entire sample period is 100.\n",
        "5.  **Econometric Analysis:** The final BRUI is integrated into a VAR model with key UK macroeconomic variables. The model is used to generate IRFs that trace the economic impact of a one-standard-deviation shock to the BRUI.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Core Components (Notebook Structure)\n",
        "\n",
        "The `brexit_related_uncertainty_index_draft.ipynb` notebook is structured as a logical pipeline with modular functions for each task:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Task 0: `validate_parameters`**: The initial quality gate for all inputs.\n",
        "-   **Task 1: `cleanse_data`**: Handles data quality and temporal scoping.\n",
        "-   **Task 2: `prepare_lexicons`**: Optimizes keyword lists for high-performance matching.\n",
        "-   **Task 3: `preprocess_text_corpus`**: The foundational NLP pipeline.\n",
        "-   **Task 4: `load_spacy_model_for_ner`, `apply_ner_to_corpus`**: LLM-based entity extraction.\n",
        "-   **Task 5: `attribute_uncertainty_in_corpus`**: The core uncertainty attribution algorithm.\n",
        "-   **Task 6 & 7: `calculate_brui`, `calculate_crui`**: Final index construction.\n",
        "-   **Task 8: `prepare_data_for_var`**: Prepares data for econometric modeling.\n",
        "-   **Task 9: `estimate_var_model`**: Estimates and identifies the VAR model.\n",
        "-   **Task 10: `run_post_estimation_analysis`**: Computes IRFs, FEVDs, and confidence intervals.\n",
        "-   **Task 11: `plot_...` functions**: The visualization suite.\n",
        "-   **Main Orchestrator: `run_brexit_uncertainty_analysis`**: Executes the entire pipeline.\n",

        "Important game-changer economic events and transformations cause uncertainties that may affect investment decisions, capital flows, international trade, and macroeconomic variables. One such major transformation is Brexit, which refers to the multiyear process through which the UK withdrew from the EU. This study develops and uses a new Brexit-Related Uncertainty Index (BRUI). In creating this index, we apply Text Mining, Context Window, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Large Language Models (LLMs) from Deep Learning techniques to analyse the monthly country reports of the Economist Intelligence Unit from May 2012 to January 2025. Additionally, we employ a standard vector autoregression (VAR) analysis to examine the model-implied responses of various macroeconomic variables to BRUI shocks. While developing the BRUI, we also create a complementary COVID-19 Related Uncertainty Index (CRUI) to distinguish the uncertainties stemming from these distinct events. Empirical findings and comparisons of BRUI with other earlier-developed uncertainty indexes demonstrate the robustness of the new index. This new index can assist British policymakers in measuring and understanding the impacts of Brexit-related uncertainties, enabling more effective policy formulation."

        "# Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Step 1: The Core Problem and the Paper's Stated Contribution**\n",
        "\n",
        "The fundamental problem the authors address is the difficulty in quantifying the *specific* economic uncertainty generated by the multi-year Brexit process. Previous attempts, they argue, have several limitations:\n",
        "*   **Static Measures:** Using a simple dummy variable for \"post-referendum\" is too crude; it doesn't capture the evolving nature and intensity of uncertainty.\n",
        "*   **Conflated Shocks:** Existing uncertainty indices (like the general Economic Policy Uncertainty index) struggle to disentangle Brexit-related anxiety from other major shocks, most notably the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
        "*   **Limited Scope:** Some specialized Brexit indices are based on surveys (which can be subjective), end too early (e.g., 2016), or haven't been updated.\n",
        "\n",
        "The authors' primary contribution is the creation of a new, dynamic **Brexit-Related Uncertainty Index (BRUI)**. Its key purported advantages are:\n",
        "1.  **Methodological Sophistication:** It uses modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a \"Context Window\" approach to ensure uncertainty keywords are directly related to Brexit.\n",
        "2.  **Disentanglement:** It explicitly creates a parallel **COVID-19 Related Uncertainty Index (CRUI)** to methodologically separate and control for pandemic-induced uncertainty.\n",
        "3.  **Temporal Coverage:** The index runs from May 2012 (when the term \"Brexit\" first appeared) to a projected January 2025, covering the entire lifecycle from conception through implementation and its aftermath.\n",
        "4.  **Data Source:** It relies on the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) country reports, which are more standardized and analytical than newspaper articles, potentially reducing sensationalism and editorial bias.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Step 2: The Methodological Pipeline – From Text to Index**\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the computational core of the paper. The process for creating the BRUI is a multi-stage data processing and analysis pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **a. Data Ingestion and Preparation:**\n",
        "    *   The raw data is a corpus of monthly EIU reports for the UK.\n",
        "    *   Using Python libraries (like `PyMuPDF`), they extract the raw text from PDFs and convert it to lowercase for consistency.\n",
        "    *   Standard NLP pre-processing is applied using the Natural Language Toolkit (`NLTK`):\n",
        "        *   **Tokenization:** Breaking text into individual words (tokens).\n",
        "        *   **Stopword Removal:** Eliminating common, non-informative words ('the', 'a', 'is').\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **b. The \"Context Window\" Algorithm (The Key Innovation):**\n",
        "    This is the cleverest part of their methodology. Instead of just counting keyword frequencies in a document, they enforce a *contextual link*.\n",
        "    1.  They define three distinct keyword lexicons (word lists), as shown in their **Table 1**:\n",
        "        *   **Uncertainty Terms (U):** `uncertainty`, `volatile`, `risk`, `instability`, etc.\n",
        "        *   **Brexit-Related Terms (BRK):** `brexit`, `article 50`, `customs union`, `leave the EU`, etc.\n",
        "        *   **COVID-19-Related Terms (CRK):** `covid`, `pandemic`, `lockdown`, `vaccine`, etc.\n",
        "    2.  The algorithm iterates through the text. Whenever it finds an **Uncertainty term (U)**, it opens a \"Context Window\" of 10 words before and 10 words after it.\n",
        "    3.  It then applies a classification logic within this window:\n",
        "        *   If a **BRK** is found in the window but no **CRK** is present, the uncertainty is counted as **purely Brexit-related**.\n",
        "        *   If both a **BRK** and a **CRK** are found, the uncertainty is classified as **mixed**. The authors then allocate this count proportionally based on the overall monthly frequency of pure Brexit vs. pure COVID uncertainty words. This is a pragmatic solution to the attribution problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **c. Index Construction and Normalization:**\n",
        "    1.  For each month, they calculate the **Total Brexit-Related Uncertainty Keyword Number (TBRUKN)**.\n",
        "    2.  To account for varying report lengths, they perform **standardization**:\n",
        "        `BRUI_raw = (TBRUKN for that month) / (Total number of words in that month's report)`\n",
        "    3.  Finally, they perform **normalization**: The entire time series of `BRUI_raw` is scaled so that the peak value is 100. This makes the index easy to interpret and compare over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Step 3: Empirical Findings – What the Index Reveals**\n",
        "\n",
        "Having constructed the index, the authors use it in two ways: descriptive analysis and econometric modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **a. The Evolution of Brexit Uncertainty (Figure 2):**\n",
        "    The time-series plot of the BRUI is the paper's central visual. It clearly shows three phases:\n",
        "    1.  **Pre-Brexit Period (2012-2016):** Low-level, rising uncertainty as the referendum is promised and approaches.\n",
        "    2.  **Transition Period (2016-2020):** Extreme volatility and the highest peaks in uncertainty, corresponding to the referendum result, failed withdrawal agreements, the \"Irish backstop\" crisis, and general political chaos.\n",
        "    3.  **Post-Brexit Period (2020-onward):** A lower, but still elevated and persistent, level of uncertainty related to the implementation of new trade rules, the Northern Ireland Protocol, and ongoing economic friction.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **b. Robustness Checks (Figures 3, 4, 5):**\n",
        "    To validate their index, they correlate it with the other existing Brexit indices.\n",
        "    *   **High Correlation (0.82 and 0.75)** with the Bloom et al. (BRUI_B) and Chung et al. (BRUI_C) indices suggests their BRUI is capturing a similar underlying phenomenon, which lends it credibility.\n",
        "    *   **Low Correlation (0.35)** with the Baker et al. (BRUI_Baker) index is expected and logical, as that index ends in 2016, capturing only the initial, low-level phase of uncertainty.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **c. Econometric Impact Analysis (The VAR Model):**\n",
        "    This is where they connect the index to the real economy. They use a standard **Vector Autoregression (VAR)** model, which examines the dynamic interrelationships between a set of variables.\n",
        "    *   **Impulse-Response Functions (Figure 6):** This analysis answers the question: \"What happens to the economy when there is a sudden, unexpected shock (a spike) in Brexit uncertainty?\" The results are consistent with economic theory: a positive shock to BRUI leads to a statistically significant *decline* in GDP, exports, imports, and employment, and a *depreciation* of the British Pound against the Euro.\n",
        "    *   **Forecast-Error Variance Decomposition (Table 3):** This quantifies the importance of BRUI shocks. It shows that a meaningful percentage of the forecast errors in key variables like GDP (3.4%), GBP/USD (4.41%), and Imports (2.49%) are explained by fluctuations in the BRUI. This demonstrates that Brexit uncertainty is not just noise but a tangible driver of macroeconomic outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Step 4: Conclusion and Critical Assessment**\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper concludes that the BRUI is a robust and valuable tool. It confirms that Brexit was not a one-off event but a long-term source of structural uncertainty with persistent negative effects on the UK economy.\n",
        "\n",
        "**My professorial critique:**\n",
        "*   **Strengths:** The methodology for disentangling COVID-19 and Brexit uncertainty is the paper's strongest feature. The use of EIU reports is a sound choice for data. The VAR analysis provides a solid econometric foundation for their claims.\n",
        "*   **Limitations (as acknowledged by the authors):** The index is, by definition, sensitive to the initial choice of keywords. While their list is comprehensive, it's not exhaustive. The reliance on a single data source (EIU) could introduce a specific institutional viewpoint, though it aids consistency.\n",
        "*   **Avenues for Future Research:** The proportional allocation for \"mixed\" uncertainty is a reasonable heuristic, but more advanced machine learning models (e.g., topic modeling with attribution) could refine this. Applying this methodology to create sector-specific indices (e.g., for finance, manufacturing) would be a valuable extension.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, this is a strong piece of applied econometric and computational work. It provides a tangible, data-driven tool that improves upon existing measures and offers clear, actionable insights into the economic consequences of a major geopolitical event. It's an excellent example of how modern data science techniques can be leveraged to answer pressing economic questions."
